# 0x03. Log Parsing

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and is assigned to Alexa Orrico, a Software Engineer at Holberton School. The project focuses on implementing a log parsing algorithm in Python.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a Python script that can efficiently parse log files and extract relevant information from them. The log files will contain various data, and the script should be able to handle large log files while maintaining optimal performance.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Code should follow the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

```
0x03-Log_Parsing/
│-- parser.py
│-- log_file.txt
│-- README.md
```

## How to Use the Script
1. Ensure you have Python 3 (version 3.4.3) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project folder `0x03-Log_Parsing`.
4. Run the `parser.py` script using the following command:

```bash
./parser.py log_file.txt
```

Replace `log_file.txt` with the path to the log file you want to parse.

## Additional Notes
- Make sure to handle edge cases and error scenarios gracefully.
- Consider the performance of your algorithm, especially when processing large log files.
- Keep the code clean and well-documented, adhering to the PEP 8 style guidelines.

Good luck with your project! If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy coding!
