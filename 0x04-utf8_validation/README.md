# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

## Project Description
This project aims to implement an algorithm in Python to validate UTF-8 encoded data. UTF-8 is a character encoding scheme that represents Unicode characters using variable-length byte sequences. The goal is to ensure that the given data is correctly encoded according to the UTF-8 standard.

## Resources
Read or watch the following resources to better understand UTF-8 encoding and Unicode:
- [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
- [Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4)

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder.

## Project Structure
The project should have the following structure:

```
0x04.UTF8_Validation/
--- 0-validate_utf8.py
```

## Description of Files
- `0-validate_utf8.py`: a method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.
